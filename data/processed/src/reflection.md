# Reflection on Data Cleaning Project 
# What Copilot Generated 
For this assignment, I used GitHub and Copliot through Visual Studio Code to assist me when building the data cleaning script for my data set. I used Copilot to help generate the "load_data," "clean_column_names," and "explain_data" functions. Copilot was able to assist me when generating functons in my data_cleaning.py. Also, Copilot assisted me when writing clear comments above functions, describing what each function will do, and Copilot gave usful suggestions for column names, which saved time. I started typing out what I wanted Copilot to generate, and it gave me code in a ghost format that I can review and adjust. 
# Other uses of Copilot 
I also used copilot for organization and making sure the script was using consistent formatting. Although I didn't use every suggestion, it was useful for identifying alternative ways to write my code. The explain function in visual studio code was very beneficial to help understand each part of the cleaning process. This helped me to understand each line of code and make sure it makes sense and fits the script. 

Working inside the GitHub repository showed me how a real data project is structured. Also, GitHub and Visual Studio Code showed me how files in a project connect: raw data is kept in the data/raw folder, and the cleaned outputs are sent to data/processed. Overall, Copilot made the coding process faster and ensured correct formatting, and made sure it fit the script assignment.
