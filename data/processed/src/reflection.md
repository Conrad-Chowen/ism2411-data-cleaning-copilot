# Reflection on Data Cleaning Project 
# What Copilot Generated 
I used Copilot to help generate the "load_data," "clean_column_names," and "explain_data" functions. Copilot assisted me when writing clear comments above functions, describing what each function will do, and Copilot gave usful suggestions for column names, which saved time. I started typing out what I wanted Copilot to generate, and it gave me code in a ghost format that I can review and adjust. 
# Other uses of Copilot 
I also used copilot for organization and making sure the script was using consistent formatting. Although I didn't use every suggestion, it was useful for identifying alternative ways to write my code. 

Working with GitHub and Visual Studio Code also showed me how files in a project connect: raw data is kept in the data/raw folder, and the cleaned outputs are sent to data/processed. Overall, Copilot made the coding process faster and ensured correct formatting, and made sure it fit the script assignment.
